The HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard is designed to provide a clear understanding of employee attrition patterns within an organization. It highlights key metrics such as total attrition, average income, and attrition by job role and gender. The dashboard also explores deeper insights by comparing attrition with factors like years since last promotion, number of companies worked, and work experience. With interactive visualizations, it helps HR professionals and decision-makers identify the major reasons behind attrition, monitor workforce demographics, and develop effective strategies to improve employee retention.
